# smart-fan-controller
This project showcases a smart fan system that can be controlled using a remote, offering two operational modes: automatic and manual. In automatic mode, the fan adjusts its speed based on ambient conditions such as temperature or humidity. In manual mode, users can set the fan speed directly using the remote. The system integrates sensors for environmental monitoring and a microcontroller to process inputs, ensuring efficient and user-friendly operation.  This project demonstrates practical implementation of embedded systems, sensor integration, and user interaction design, making it a versatile and innovative solution for smart home applications.
