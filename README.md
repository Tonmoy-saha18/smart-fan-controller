# smart-fan-controller
This project presents a smart fan controllable via remote with two modes: automatic and manual. In automatic mode, the fan adjusts speed based on temperature or humidity, while manual mode lets users set speed directly. It integrates sensors and a microcontroller, showcasing embedded systems and user-friendly design for smart home use.
